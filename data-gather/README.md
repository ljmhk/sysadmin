Data Gather
========

A script which collects information from the magento base and exports the information into CSV files for use with load testing tools, such as gatling-tool. The script collects a list of product and category url's as well as a list of search terms. The script also outputs a list of basic products without options in case checkout testing is required.

Simply pass the script the full path to the magento instance and it will do the rest.
